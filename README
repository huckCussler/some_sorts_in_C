Basic sorting algorithms implemented in C, written for the summer algorithms review group at the Universiy of
Utah.  The sorts written are selection, counting, and heap.

Running any of the programs without arguments will create a default array of integers to be sorted.  Alternatively,
a user may supply the name of a file with the elements to be sorted.  The file must contain one element per line
and nothing else.

All of the sorts are written to work on integers.
